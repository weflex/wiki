# Third Party Services

While building our own services and applications, we use Third Party Services  like Virtual Private Server hosting, Cloud Storage, etc. I would like to serve you a complete list of services we are using at this moment.


## Apple Developer Program

_Apple Developer Program_ is _the only_ approach to distribute our Apps to iOS. Currently we are using a _Personal Developer Account_, but a migration to _Organization Account_ is in the plan.

1. _weflex-assets_ where we store our static assets like fonts, shared stylesheets, application builds, etc, and
2. _weflex-studio_ where all the contents users uploaded while using Studio System were stored.
